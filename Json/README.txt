1. Replace IFZ.dll in Infection Free Zone_Data\Managed
2. place the Json folder in Infection Free Zone_Data\StreamingAssets
3. Run game, hit ~ then enable cheats, then spawn vehicle, then slect any vehicle, the code should run, 
if it doesn't, click again (or redo this step if you right click) then right click and press ~
4. look into the Json folder, then any folder ending with dump (For example, PlacableObjectsDump has the
files for buildings)
5. Copy a file from a dump folder into a non-dump folder (PlacableObjects) and open it
6. edit it however you like, just don't mess up the syntax!
P.S. vehicleType is empty, fill it with the name of the file ("vehicleType" : "ve_truck")
I've added my own mods to the tool factory, feel free to remove them
