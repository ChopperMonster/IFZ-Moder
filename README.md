# IFZ-Moder
This is meant to add the ability to mod buildings, vehicles, weapons, gear, and research
use at your own risk, will need to be updated with every version
GAME VERSION: 0.24.6.18 BETA+

1. Replace IFZ.dll in Infection Free Zone_Data\Managed
2. place the Json folder in Infection Free Zone_Data\StreamingAssets
3. Run game, load up a save or start new game
4. look into the Json folder, then any folder ending with "Dump" (For example, PlacableObjectsDump has the
files for buildings)
5. Copy a file from a "Dump" folder into a non-Dump folder (For example, PlacableObjects) and open it
6. edit it however you like, just don't mess up the syntax!
7. Quit to menu and load your game

P.S. If you want to mod vehicles, vehicleType is empty, fill it with the name of the file (Example  "vehicleType" : "ve_truck")

I've added my own mods to the game, feel free to remove them (empty the non-dump folders)
